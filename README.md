# trivia-game
This is a simple trivia game that adds effects via jQuery


The user is able to read the clue, view an optional hint, and select their answer.

I have added a few different effects. A hint box will slide up and down. When you click an incorrect answer, it will fade away and a frowny face will appear. When you click the correct answer, the frowny face will disappear and a smiley face will take its place.

To complete this project, I targeted HTML elements in jQuery, created event handlers, used several jQuery Effects methods.
